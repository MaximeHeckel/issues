# GitHub issues manager for Desktop & Chrome

This application is a simple 100% static application to manage your GitHub issues from your desktop, Chrome OS or your browser. It only uses the GitHub API and the localstorage (no specific backend needed). This tiny project was started the 9th september 2014; and I'm planning on really maintening it in the future. You can test it online at: [http://samypesse.github.io/issues/](samypesse.github.io/issues), desktop builds are coming soon.
